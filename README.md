# Calendar Application with Task Manager

This is a simple calendar application written in C++ that allows the user to display a calendar for any given year and month. The application also allows users to add tasks for specific days in the selected month and displays them alongside the calendar.

## Features

- Display the calendar for a specific month and year.
- Add tasks for specific days in the selected month.
- Mark days with tasks by adding a `*` symbol next to the day number in the calendar.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a year (must be 1900 or later).
2. The user is prompted to enter a month (between 1 and 12).
3. The program then displays the calendar for that month and year.
4. The user can choose to add tasks for any day in the selected month.
5. The calendar will display a `*` next to the days that have tasks.
6. A list of added tasks will be shown after the calendar.
